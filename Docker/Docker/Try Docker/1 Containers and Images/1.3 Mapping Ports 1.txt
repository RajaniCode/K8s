1.3 Mapping Ports 1

There we go, our first container!

But there's a little problem: We should be able to access the default index.html page on that server by visiting http://localhost:80/index.html, but when we do that we just get an error that we can't connect to port 80. Fortunately, we can solve this by adding a -p flag with some port numbers after it to the run command.

Type docker container run -p 80:80 httpd:2.4.
