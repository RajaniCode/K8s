1.5 Accessing a Container

Now when we try to access http://localhost:80/index.html we'll get an error, but if we try to access http://localhost:9999/index.html then we'll see the default "It works" page! This is a really useful feature of Docker â€” the ability to map any port on the host (your computer) to any port on the container.

Accessing the default page is cool, but what about getting into a running container and looking around? The docker container exec command lets us run commands against a running container. But before we can run a command, we need to know the ID of the container.

2. Type docker container exec elegant_noether du -mh.
