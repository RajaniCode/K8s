3.2 Copying Files into a Running Container

One way to get a file into a container is with the docker container cp command. Here, we’ve got a container that’s already running with the name elegant_noether.

Like many Unix commands, the order of the arguments after the cp are important. First, we write a path to the location of the file we want to copy on your host machine, and after that we write the container ID, followed by a colon, followed by a path in the container where we want the file to be copied to.

1. Type curl localhost:80/page.html to confirm that the page.html file doesn't exist already.
