3.5 Creating a Volume

The first two approaches involved copying a file into a container. But as soon as the container is modified and stopped, all of those changes disappear. This is a problem if we’re using a container for local development, and one way to fix this problem is to use a data volume to create a connection between files on our local computer (host) and the filesystem in the container.

1. Type docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /my-files:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs web-server:1.1 to create a link between the folder /my-files on your host machine and the htdocs folder in the container. This also runs the container in the background.

4. Now that we’re in the right folder, type ls -la. This will show us that the container thinks those files on our local machine are inside of it, even though we know the truth — that we’ve created a volume that’s linking those local files to the container!
